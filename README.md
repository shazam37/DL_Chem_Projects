# DL_Chem_Projects

. Implemented SchNet (a self-attention GCNN based model) to predict the space groups of different crystal structures

. Developed a XAI model (using Shapley values, Integrated gradients, and Counterfactuals) that can provide actionable and complete explanation of the model for predicting the hemolytic activity of a peptide sequence

. VAE model for generating new molecules and regressing on the latent space of VAE for specific property prediction

. Generative RNN model for molecular generation that can be hosted on a browser using Javascript

. Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to predict the DFT energies on QM9 dataset

. Equivariant Neural Network (ENN) to predict the molecular trajectories with respect to time

. CNN based classification model (on tokenized amino acids) to predict the solubility of a protein structure

. Regression models (Linear regression, Kernel based, and RNN) to predict the solubility of molecules on AqSol database

. MLP based classification model to predict whether a drug will pass the clinical trials on MoleculeNet database
